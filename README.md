# SnailSploit_Recon_extension
Shipped a lightweight Chrome MV3 tool for instant recon: SnailSploit Recon Extension. It surfaces security headers, IP intel (DoH/rDNS/RDAP), Shodan InternetDB (ports/CPEs), CPE→CVE enrichment, passive+live subdomains, a pragmatic secrets scanner, and tech fingerprints — all without API keys (VT is optional).
